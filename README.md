Welcome to my repository of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges! These solutions are written in **Python**.

Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by year and day. Each day's folder typically contains the solution script and (optionally) the example input.
